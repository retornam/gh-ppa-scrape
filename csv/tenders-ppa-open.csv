The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources has received financing from the World Bank toward the cost of the Second Land Administration Project, and intends to apply part of the proceeds for consulting services for the preparation of Regional Spatial Development Frameworks for the Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions of Ghana.   The Second Land Administration Project (LAP-2) is a follow up project of LAP-1 and is being implemented based on the National Land Policy which came into effect in 1999.  The Project concentrates on completing outstanding legal and institutional reforms, removing business bottlenecks, promoting transparency and addressing various land administration challenges with the view to: (i) speeding up land registration and delivery of titles and deeds; (ii) enhancing security of tenure; and (iii) strengthening the settlement of land disputes, among others.  The Project is being implemented through four-interrelated Components, namely:  1. strengthening the Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework for Land Administration;  2. decentralizing and improving Business and Service Delivery Processes;  3. providing improved Maps and Spatial Data for Land Administration; and  4. engaging in Human Resource Development and Project Management.  A National Spatial Development Framework (NSDF) has been completed and will provide enough guidance for the preparation of Regional Spatial Development Frameworks.  The objectives of the consultancy are to prepare a Spatial Development Framework (RSDF) and formulate a programme of action and investment plan to facilitate implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the plan for the Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions of Ghana.   The consulting services (â€œthe Servicesâ€) include preparation of a Regional Spatial Development Framework to provide a spatial strategy for achieving defined social, economic and environmental policies as they relate to the regions. The Regional Spatial Development Frameworks are expected to span 20 years and provide perspectives and proposals for what kinds of development should take place, how much of it should occur, where this should happen, and how this should happen. The broad activities will include  â€¢ Assessment of the current situation and framework conditions for spatial development of the regions;  â€¢ Analysis of data and modelling of options for preparation of the Regional Spatial Development Frameworks;   â€¢ Formulation of the Regional Spatial Development Frameworks  and appropriate programmes of action; and,  â€¢ Stakeholder consultations","Central Tender Review Committee","10th June, 2016","20th February, 2017","USA Dollar","$334209.34","Spatial Solutions Limited","","","","-"
